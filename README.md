# HW-BootsrapPortfolio
Bootstrap Portfolio

This project displays 3 htmls, which follow a responsive design using columns and rows with Bootstrap CSS, jQuery, and Javascript, to fit a desired design.

It displays visually how objects are aligned in a website given the proper commands. As well as it is great practice with using bootstrap components images, positioning sections, utilizing responsive designs and adapting the pages behavior acorrdingly. 

To install or try out the project users need a brower and open up the html.

Users can get further help in w3shcools or MDN or stockoverflow.
